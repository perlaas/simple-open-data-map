# simple-open-data-map
Simple web map for open data
## Purpose
A simple but still useful web map for open data using open standards as OGC. Useful as it is, setting configuration you need in conf.js, or as a starting point. 
Currently tested on open data from government agencies in Sweden using OCG WMTS and WMS. Spatial reference system SWEREF99 TM, epgs 3006.
## Design
- Only client side logic. 
  - Exemption: server side (php) API to proxy calls to services that does not support CORS.
- Add libraries only if they give enough benefit. For example:
  - Use plain XMLHttpRequest instead of adding jQuery only to use it for callbacks.
- Use simple standard built in functions in main library if possible. For example:
  - Use Leaflet standard controls: layers, scale, popup and so on.
- Use standard protocols when possible For example:
  - OGC WMS getMap and getFeatureInfo
  - OGC WMTS.
- Use simple parsing of callback results (html, XML or JSON). Avoid parsing library if very simple text parsing is possible. For example: 
  - Use getFeatureInfo in html 
  - Look if there is an html-tag with link (find '>http:') then use it as a link in popup
  - Otherwise use html result as it is.

## Usage
- Use conf.js for configuration of OGC services.
- Use featureInfo.php for request to server in same domain to handle OGC services not supporting CORS.
- Include prerequisites. Example found in karta.html
