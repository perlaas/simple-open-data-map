# simple-open-data-map
Simple web map for open data
## Purpose
A simple but still useful web map for open data using open standards as OGC. Functionality include pan and zoom in the map as well as including identify objects at a user selected position in the map. Useful as it is, setting configuration you need in conf.js, or as a starting point. 

Currently tested on open data from government agencies in Sweden using OCG WMTS and WMS. Spatial reference system SWEREF99 TM, epgs 3006.

The code needs some cleaning and comments but is useful as it is.
## Design
- Only client side logic. 
  - Exemption: server side (php) API to proxy calls to services that does not support CORS or does not have wildcard same-origin policy.
- Keep logic simple to avoid the need for many libraries
- Use standard javascript over library for simple tasks
- Add libraries only if they give enough benefit. For example:
  - Use plain XMLHttpRequest instead of adding jQuery only to use it for callbacks.
- Use simple standard built in functions in main library if possible. For example:
  - Use Leaflet standard controls: layers, scale, popup and so on.
- Use standard protocols when possible For example:
  - OGC WMS getMap and getFeatureInfo
  - OGC WMTS.
- Use the power of useful sites with open data for needed functions. Examples:
  - Use Openstreetmap for routing between geopositions from last two clicks in map instead of implementing it
- Use simple html links with geolocation to other useful sites
- Use simple parsing of callback results (html, XML or JSON). 
- Avoid parsing library if very simple text parsing is possible. For example: 
  - Use html return type in WMS getFeatureInfo requests 
  - Look if there is an html-tag with link (find '>http:') then use it as a link in popup
  - Otherwise use html result as it is.

## Usage
- Use conf.js for configuration of OGC services.
- Use featureInfo.php for request to server in same domain to handle OGC services not supporting CORS or does not have wildcard same-origin policy.
- Include prerequisites. Example found in karta.html
