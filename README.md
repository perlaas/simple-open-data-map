# simple-open-data-map
Simple web map for open data
## Purpose
A simple and useful web map for open data using open standards as OGC. Useful as it is or as a starting point. 
Currently tested on open data from government agencies in Sweden using OCG WMTS and WMS. Spatial reference system SWEREF99 TM, epgs 3006.
## Design
- Only client side logic. Exemption: server side (php) API to proxy calls to services that does not support CORS.
- Use standard protocols when possible, i.e. OGC WMS getMap and getFeatureInfo, OGC WMTS.
- Use simple parsing of callback results (XML or JSON). For example find xml-tag with link (find '>http:') and use it as a link in popup.

## Usage
- Use conf.js for configuration of OGC services.
- Use featureInfo.php for request to server in same domain to handle OGC services not supporting CORS.
- Include prerequisites. Example found in karta.html
